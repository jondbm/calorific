  <h2>What's this site for?</h2>
  This site is for people following a LeanGains or Carb-Cycling diet and exercise programme. Every day enter the food you eat, and we will calculate whether you've gone over or under your recommended macro allowances (Protein, Fats, Carbohydrates and Calories) for that day.

  <p></p>
  See how you're doing over time, and adjust your macros to suit your goals.
